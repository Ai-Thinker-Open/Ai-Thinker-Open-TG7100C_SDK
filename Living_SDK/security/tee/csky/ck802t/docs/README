TOOLCHAIN

Alibaba TrustZone/TEE SDK is built according to the architecture that the SDK serves. Now it is for C-Sky and its toolchain version is "csky-abiv2-elf-tools-x86_64-minilibc-20151217".

SAMPLE

There is a sample code for developping a CA and its TA accordingly. You could find it in $/samples/xor.

BUILD

Go into $/build and run:
   ./b  ---- for release version, TEST=N in tee.cfg
   ./b test ---- for test version, TEST=Y in tee.cfg
The outputs are:
1. non-secure world (or non-trusted world)
There are two object files for non-secure world: $/src/ntw/tee_drv.o and $/samples/xor/ntw/xor_stub.o
2. secure world (or trusted world)
There is one binary file for secure world: $/out/tee_tw.bin
3. test cases and test bed
There is one binary file of non-secure world which include tee_drv, test CAs and test beds :$/out/test_bed.bin

RUN

Use CDS to flash tee_tw.bin and test_bed.bin and run;
