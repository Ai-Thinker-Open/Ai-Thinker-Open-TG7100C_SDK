 * @mainpage SSV6266 source code documentation
 *
 * This documentation describes the SSV6266.
 *
 * @section mainpage_introduction General Description
 *
 * The SV6266P is a low-power single chip
 * device providing for the highest level of
 * integration for internet of thing embedded
 * systems. It is designed to support all
 * mandatory IEEE 802.11b data rates of 1, 2,
 * 5.5 and 11 Mbps, all 802.11g payload data
 * rates of 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 54 Mbps,
 * as well as 802.11n MCS0~MCS7, HT20/HT40,
 * 800ns and 400ns guard interval.
 * It includes a dual band WLAN CMOS efficient
 * power amplifier (PA) and an internal low noise
 * amplifier (LNA). The Radio Frequency Frontend
 * is single-ended bi-directional input and
 * output.
 * The SV6266P has additional LDOs and DCDC
 * buck convertor that could provide noise
 * isolation for digital and analog supplies and
 * excellent power efficient with minimum BOM
 * cost.
 * The SV6266P provides multiple peripheral
 * interfaces including SPI_ MASTER,
 * UART_DATA, UART_DEBUG, I2C_MASTER,
 * I2S, etc.
 * The only external clock source needed for
 * SV6266P based designs is a high speed
 * crystal or oscillator. A variety of reference
 * clocks are supported which include 19.2, 20,
 * 24, 25, 26, 38.4, 40 and 52 MHz
 *
